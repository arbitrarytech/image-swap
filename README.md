==========

A simple Chrome extension that replaces images throughout
websites to mess with people as my nephew sees fit.

To install, download directory somewhere on victim's computer,
then open the Chrome Extensions settings and check "Enable
Developer Mode", then "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the
directory.
